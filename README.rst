SVEC Driver
===========
This is the simplified version of the SVEC driver which only purpose is
to export an interface to enable the users to program their bitstream on
the SVEC FPGA.

Futuristic Vision
=================
Actually this is not a driver for the SVEC card but for that little gateware
core in the SVEC bootloader FPGA. In the future we can think about standardize
other designs around this concept. Then this driver will become the FPGA
programmer driver for a set of devices.
