sveclib - a tiny userspace library (and a set of tools) allowing developers to play with the svec.

The library provides:
- raw I/O to a spec in particular slot (uses geographical addressing). Currently, there's 
  a fixed A32/D32/SINGLE mapping available and the memory can be accesed by calling 
  svec_writel()/svec_readl()
- application FPGA firmware loader (svec-fwloader)
- LM32 CPU firmware loader (svec-cl)
- WR Core virtual UART console (svec-vuart)

All these tools require the slot location to be specified with -b command line switch.

Requirements: Requires vmebus driver to be installed (tested on MEN A20). 

Compilation: just run make.
